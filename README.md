# Reverse Insertion Sort

Consider the code for insertion sort we covered in class:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var val = arr[i];
    var j;
    for(j = i; j > 0 && arr[j-1] > val; j--) {
      arr[j] = arr[j-1];
    }
    arr[j] = val;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Change this function such that it works from the end of the array rather than
the beginning, `insertionSortReverse()` -- only the direction of
iterating over the elements is reversed, the array is still sorted the same way
(ascending). Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Average-Case Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

The average case time complexity for this function is $\Theta(n^2)$. This is 
because the inner loop will traverse half the unsorted section of the array
for each iteration of the outer loop. While the unsorted section of the array
gets smaller after every iteration, this doesn't matter because after using
Gauss' Trick to compute half of the sum from 1 to n, we are left with n(n-1)/4, 
which is still in terms of n^2, just like it is for the worst case time complexity.
